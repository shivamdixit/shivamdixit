Iâ€™m a Senior Production Engineer at Uber, making Uberâ€™s Payment systems more secure and reliable. Payment is one of the domains where reliability or a security issue has the potential of costing the company millions of dollars in damages, especially at the scale of Uber. My role requires asking the right questions, using code as leverage, and solving not-so-well defined problems.

Outside of tech, my interest lies in behavioral psychology, organizational behavior, and economics.
